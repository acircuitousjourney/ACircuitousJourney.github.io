Sinking into overstuffed red plush couches, surrounded by the bustle of coffee shop talk, we invite you to please grab a cup of your favorite hot drink, put on your Personal Protective Equipment, come in and have a look around. What we have here is what those of us in the industry like to call a "travel blog" (alternatively "vanity project"). We'll be sharing all the evidence we have of our Eastward adventure, as well as wild speculations, musings and assorted criminal conspiracies.

Seeing as this is being written before we have anything even up, the [;(formatting] "" might be a ]- bit odd in the end, but please bear with us.

We're still in San Diego (at the cozy Lestat's on Park), but will soon have updates of our adventures from Arizona, Japan, and beyond. Without further ado: Welcome!
