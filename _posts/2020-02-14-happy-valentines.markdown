Valentine's day, another cafe. We're at a Starbuck's (is it owned and operated by a Battlestar Galactica pilot; are there a bunch of them?). There's something amazing, in a globalized, homogenized, dystopian hell-scape, "here, take your soma" kind of way about how you can always find a Starbucks (are the chairs here Starbucks' chairs? Sillas de Starbuck?). It's amzing that you can wander through the haute hipster establishments of Berlin dying for some free water or a change-free bathroom for years, but slip into a true Washington establishment and you know exactly what you'll get:
- The truly terrible venn-diagram of sour and cheap, Pike Place roast
- All the free water and bathroom priviledges you could want
- Fake wood panel and the all encompassing industrial rustic suburban we all love
- Little eggy bites

Never, to my great annoyance, or relief, as the mood takes me, have I ever gotten anything from a Starbuck's that I didn't expect
