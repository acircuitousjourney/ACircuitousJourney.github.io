It's all coronavirus all the time now (pic related: life before the virus). We've watched it slowly expand and eat away at the destinations we have planned.
First, China was clearly out. Then, well South Korea has a warning, but there's only a Level 2 warning from the CDC, so no problem really.
Now we're waking up in a cold sweat, scrambling for the latest news on our phones. Still a Level 2 warning from Japan, so as of right now,
February 28, we're going ahead to Tokyo, and then skipping over the whole China, Korea situation and headed straight to South East Asia.
Thinking, maybe we'll double back to those locations later. When it warms up they say the coronavirus will slow down.

Quoting Elizabeth McGraw through NPR <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/12/805256402/can-coronavirus-be-crushed-by-warmer-weather">here</a>:
"Coronaviruses tend to be associated with winter because of how they're spread," that is to say, contagious person-to-person. They're spread through
droplets through the respiratory system, and "What we know is that they're [the droplets] are better at staying afloat when the air is cold and dry".
I don't know if Elizabeth McGraw makes me feel any better, but at least I don't think it's any worse.

In any case, plug for World Nomad's, which will medi-vac you from basically anywhere (need a special plan at the top of Everest, though).
Opening minds is great and all, but at least in this instance we're not in any hurry for a first hand experience.
